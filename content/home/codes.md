[exuber](https://cran.r-project.org/package=exuber): Econometric Analysis of Explosive Time Series

<!-- [![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/exuber)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=exuber) -->

> Testing for and dating periods of explosive dynamics (exuberance) in time series
> using recursive unit root tests as proposed by [Phillips, P. C., Shi, S. and Yu, J. (2015a)](https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12132).


<!-- > Simulate a variety of periodically-collapsing bubble models. The estimation
> and simulation utilize the matrix inversion lemma from the recursive least squares
> algorithm, which results in a significant speed improvement. -->
