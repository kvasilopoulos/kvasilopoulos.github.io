  <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>

I am a macroeconomist and a Teaching Associate in the Department of Economics, Lancaster University. My primary research interests include theoretical and applied macroeconomics focused on the real estate markets. In particular, I examine the business cycle, property-price and investment dynamics when there is competition between households and firms for real estate. My secondary research interests focuses on explosive dynamics and asset predictability.

I am also affiliated with the Housing Observatory, an initiative aiming to improve our understanding of housing markets. Housing Observatory is comprised of two projects, the [International Housing Observatory](https://int.housing-observatory.com/), which is in collaboration with the Globalization & Monetary Policy Institute of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the [UK Housing Observatory](https://uk.housing-observatory.com/) of Lancaster University.
