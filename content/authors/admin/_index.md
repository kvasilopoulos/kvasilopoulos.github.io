# Hi, I am Kostas! 

I am a macroeconomist and PhD candidate in Economics at Lancaster University. My research interests include theoretical and applied macroeconomics focused on the real estate markets. In particular, I examine the part of Commercial Real Estate in the economy and its interaction with the Housing market.
