abstract = "During the last few decades, the Chinese stock market has experienced great turbulence, with periods of rapid price increases followed by severe market crashes. An explanation for this volatile behavior is that of speculative bubbles. Although popular, this hypothesis is difficult to examine. The reason is that most econometric tests for bubbles actually examine a composite hypothesis: bubbles and a correctly specified model for market fundamentals. Because rejection of the null may be solely due to model misspecification, these tests are inconclusive.  We propose a novel approach that utilizes information in the prices of dual-listed companies to alleviate this problem. The basic idea is that stocks that trade both in the Shenzen-Shangai and the Hong Kong markets have the same underlying fundamentals and, therefore, divergence in their prices must reflect speculative dynamics. By applying the recently developed recursive unit root method of Phillips et al (2015) to a large number of dual-listed stocks, we find strong evidence in favor of bubbles in the Chinese stock market."
