The recursive least-squares algorithm that we introduce in our implementation of these techniques utilizes the matrix inversion lemma and in that way achieves significant speed improvements.  We illustrate the speed gains in a simulation experiment, and provide illustrations of the package using artificial series and a panel on international house prices.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"exuber: Recursive Right-Tailed Unit Root Testing with R","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Efthymios Pavlidis","Kostas Vasilopoulos"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\r\r\r\rClick the Slides button above to demo Academic's Markdown slides feature.\r\r\rSupplementary notes can be added here, including [code and math](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/). --!\r","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589538930,"objectID":"95dbd623eb17a61d7a8af862b5f18e86","permalink":"/publication/ahpremia/index/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ahpremia/index/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a novel approach for testing for rational speculative bubbles in segmented capital markets. The basic idea is that, under capital controls, heterogeneity of speculative expectations across international equity markets causes financial assets with identical cash flow promises to trade at different prices. Because these deviations from the law of one price inherit the properties of the speculative bubble process, they display periods of explosive dynamics and have predictive power for future movements in equity prices in sample. These two hypotheses can be examined empirically using sequential unit root tests and predictive regressions. An attractive feature of this approach for bubble detection is that it does not require the specification of a model for market fundamentals, thus mitigating the well-known joint hypothesis problem. The focus of the paper is on mainland Chinese companies that cross list shares in Hong Kong. China is an ideal setting for our analysis because of the significant restrictions on capital movements imposed by the authorities and the turbulent behaviour of its stock market over the last decades.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Speculative Bubbles in Segmented Markets: Evidence from Chinese Cross-Listed Stocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584359389,"objectID":"9260a1bd38ad457fcbbc5d4ca2b02951","permalink":"/codes/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/codes/","section":"","summary":"A little more about me and how to get in touch","tags":null,"title":"Codes","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578413154,"objectID":"fd36605688ef45e10dc233c860158012","permalink":"/cv/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/","section":"","summary":"A little more about me and how to get in touch","tags":null,"title":"Codes","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Kostas Vasilopoulos","William Tayler"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\r\r\r\rClick the Slides button above to demo Academic's Markdown slides feature.\r\r\rSupplementary notes can be added here, including [code and math](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/). --!\r","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582544122,"objectID":"4110748802c09d5ef9f2e45e011f9eea","permalink":"/publication/cre/index/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cre/index/","section":"publication","summary":"The 2007-08 financial crisis exposed the magnitude through which distortions in residential and commercial real estate markets can spillover to the goods markets and the real economy. This paper develops an RBC model with a consumption good and a construction sector, where both commercial and residential real estate forms the construction sector. We investigate the property-price and investment dynamics when there is competition between households and firms for real estate and the implications this market structure has for macroeconomic fluctuations. In doing so we develop a 'real estate substitution channel', where demand shocks, by raising the costs of production create a substitution between the two types of real estate. This gives an alternative interpretation to the housing preference shock, which rather than simply representing a shift in preferences, is also explained as a supply shock to the commercial real estate. The estimated model reveals that housing preference shocks explain the largest part of the variation in property prices and residential investment, while commercial real estate prices are is driven primarily by  technology shock.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Commercial Real Estate, Housing and the Business Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578337571,"objectID":"426d522fcb82973f95d828bcc08f03ff","permalink":"/events/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/","section":"","summary":"A little more about me and how to get in touch","tags":null,"title":"Events","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Kostas Vasilopoulos"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\r\r\r\rClick the Slides button above to demo Academic's Markdown slides feature.\r\r\rSupplementary notes can be added here, including [code and math](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/). --!\r","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579475907,"objectID":"130fee4c38b1b14d52ef28024a191a32","permalink":"/publication/real-estate-mp/index/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/real-estate-mp/index/","section":"publication","summary":"Residential and commercial real estate account for a substantial share of both household wealth and capital stock in the EU countries and the US. More specifically in the US, one-third of household net worth is held in residential real estate, whilst commercial real estate typically accounts for about half the net market (replacement) value of nonfarm, nonfinancial corporate business assets (Case2000). Furthermore, fluctuations in real estate values have been shown to play a significant and unique role both the amplification and the propagation of the business cycle, especially when combined with financial frictions in the form of collateral constraints. The general mechanism is that when households or firms use real estate as a collateral for borrowing, a decline in real estate prices will reduce the value of available collateral, and with it the availability of funds for either investment or consumption, thus amplifying the decline in economic activity (Iacoviello2005, Iacoviello2010, Liu2013, Guerrieri2017). The 2007-08 financial crisis exposed the magnitude through which distortions in residential and commercial real estate markets can spillover to the goods markets and the real economy. Real estate has long been considered as hedge against inflation (Fama1977), hence the real estate market serves as a medium for the transmission of monetary policy shocks to the overall economy. There are several channels that are at play, among which two are going to be explored here. First, the role of monetary policy in affecting the behaviour of real estate investment and property prices, as opposed to other, possibly non-fundamental factors that drive house prices up and down, such as bubbles. Second, the role of borrowing in affecting and possibly amplifying the effect of changes in property prices (in turn due to both monetary and non-monetary factors) on investment, value of collateral and overall economic activity through a financial accelerator mechanism. In our analysis, we consider both commercial and residential, therefore, it is important to disaggregate investment activity. It is households that demand housing services and consumption-good firms that are using commercial real estate to facilitate their business activities. These two combined constitute the demand for real estate. Both agents are credit-constrained and are allowed to borrow only against collateral, however, they differ in the way that they secure their financing. Firms borrow at bank prime loan rate, while households request mortgage loans at the mortgage lending rate. Both residential and commercial real estate are supplied by the construction sector. Specifically, construction firms still borrow at the same rate as consumption-good firms, however since they do not own the  real estate, they cannot pledge it as collateral. The objective of this study is to develop a framework to study the transmission of monetary policy to the real estate markets. We will carry out a structural analysis using a Structural Vector Autoregression approach (SVAR), which is conditional on the identification of a restricted number of structural shocks. Similar SVAR will be constructed for both commercial and residential real estate in order to obtain comparable results for the two markets. We first estimate the market separately, when we will focus on monetary policy, real estate demand and credit supply (borrowing) of the separate markets and compare the two impulse responses in the two markets to understand similarities and differences in a systematic manner. The second part of the research will  model the construction sector, where both types of real estate are estimated jointly. A unified approach would help us further understand the potential spillovers and comovements between the two real estate sectors.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Real Estate and Monetary Policy: Residential and Commercial","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589538930,"objectID":"064444192e90761751a77634e2c08673","permalink":"/project/international-housing-observatory/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/international-housing-observatory/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding the  international house price dynamics.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"International Housing Observatory","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589538930,"objectID":"b90baa695bc96a6b8475f8994b090cb9","permalink":"/project/uk-housing-observatory/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/uk-housing-observatory/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding the UK national and regional house price dynamics.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"United Kingdom Housing Observatory","type":"project"}]
