This paper develops an RBC model with a consumption good and a construction sector, where both commercial and residential real estate forms the construction sector. We investigate the property-price and investment dynamics when there is competition between households and firms for real estate and the implications this market structure has for macroeconomic fluctuations. In doing so we develop a 'real estate substitution channel', where demand shocks, by raising the costs of production create a substitution between the two types of real estate. This gives an alternative interpretation to the housing preference shock, which rather than simply representing a shift in preferences, is also explained as a supply shock to the commercial real estate. The estimated model reveals that housing preference shocks explain the largest part of the variation in property prices and residential investment, while commercial real estate prices are is driven primarily by  technology shock.","tags":[],"title":"Commercial Real Estate, Housing and the Business Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vasilopoulos K.","Pavlidis E."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528328829,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528328829,"objectID":"95dbd623eb17a61d7a8af862b5f18e86","permalink":"/publication/ahpremia/index/","publishdate":"2018-06-07T00:47:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ahpremia/index/","section":"publication","summary":"During the last few decades, the Chinese stock market has experienced great turbulence, with periods of rapid price increases followed by severe market crashes. An explanation for this volatile behavior is that of speculative bubbles. Although popular, this hypothesis is difficult to examine. The reason is that most econometric tests for bubbles actually examine a composite hypothesis: bubbles and a correctly specified model for market fundamentals. Because rejection of the null may be solely due to model misspecification, these tests are inconclusive.  We propose a novel approach that utilizes information in the prices of dual-listed companies to alleviate this problem. The basic idea is that stocks that trade both in the Shenzen-Shangai and the Hong Kong markets have the same underlying fundamentals and, therefore, divergence in their prices must reflect speculative dynamics. By applying the recently developed recursive unit root method of Phillips et al (2015) to a large number of dual-listed stocks, we find strong evidence in favor of bubbles in the Chinese stock market.","tags":[],"title":"Speculative Bubbles in the Chinese Stock Market: Evidence from Cross-listed Stocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

The major differences are:\n You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday\u0026rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc\u0026rsquo;s Markdown. For example, you can write a task list with Blackfriday but not with Pandoc:\nWrite an R package. Write a book. \u0026hellip; Profit!  Similarly, Blackfriday does not support LaTeX math and Pandoc does. I have added the MathJax support to this theme (hugo-lithium) but there is a caveat for plain Markdown posts: you have to include math expressions in a pair of backticks (inline: `$ $`; display style: `$$ $$`), e.g., $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$.1 For R Markdown posts, you do not need the backticks, because Pandoc can identify and process math expressions.\nWhen creating a new post, you have to decide whether the post format is Markdown or R Markdown, and this can be done via the ext argument of the function blogdown::new_post(), e.g.\nblogdown::new_post(\u0026quot;Post Title\u0026quot;, ext = '.Rmd')   This is because we have to protect the math expressions from being interpreted as Markdown. You may not need the backticks if your math expression does not contain any special Markdown syntax such as underscores or asterisks, but it is always a safer choice to use backticks. When you happen to have a pair of literal dollar signs inside the same element, you can escape one dollar sign, e.g., \\$50 and $100 renders \u0026ldquo;\\$50 and $100\u0026rdquo;. ^   ","date":1483159797,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483159797,"objectID":"dac6359e86d39f18210d4aea00ef9fa8","permalink":"/post/2016-12-30-hello-markdown/","publishdate":"2016-12-30T21:49:57-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2016-12-30-hello-markdown/","section":"post","summary":"This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd).
