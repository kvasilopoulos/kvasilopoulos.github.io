This paper develops an RBC model with a consumption good and a construction sector, where both commercial and residential real estate forms the construction sector. We investigate the property-price and investment dynamics when there is competition between households and firms for real estate and the implications this market structure has for macroeconomic fluctuations. In doing so we develop a 'real estate substitution channel', where demand shocks, by raising the costs of production create a substitution between the two types of real estate. This gives an alternative interpretation to the housing preference shock, which rather than simply representing a shift in preferences, is also explained as a supply shock to the commercial real estate. The estimated model reveals that housing preference shocks explain the largest part of the variation in property prices and residential investment, while commercial real estate prices are is driven primarily by  technology shock.","tags":[],"title":"Commercial Real Estate, Housing and the Business Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavlidis E.","Vasilopoulos K."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559864829,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559864829,"objectID":"95dbd623eb17a61d7a8af862b5f18e86","permalink":"/publication/ahpremia/index/","publishdate":"2019-06-07T00:47:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ahpremia/index/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a novel approach for testing for rational speculative bubbles in segmented capital markets. The basic idea is that, under capital controls, heterogeneity of speculative expectations across international equity markets causes financial assets with identical cash flow promises to trade at different prices. Because these deviations from the law of one price inherit the properties of the speculative bubble process, they display periods of explosive dynamics and have predictive power for future movements in equity prices in sample. These two hypotheses can be examined empirically using sequential unit root tests and predictive regressions. An attractive feature of this approach for bubble detection is that it does not require the specification of a model for market fundamentals, thus mitigating the well-known joint hypothesis problem. The focus of the paper is on mainland Chinese companies that cross list shares in Hong Kong. China is an ideal setting for our analysis because of the significant restrictions on capital movements imposed by the authorities and the turbulent behaviour of its stock market over the last decades.","tags":[],"title":"Speculative Bubbles in Segmented Markets: Evidence from Chinese Cross-Listed Stocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536447600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536447600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the **Slides** button above to view the built-in slides feature.

There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday\u0026rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc\u0026rsquo;s Markdown. For example, you can write a task list with Blackfriday but not with Pandoc:\nWrite an R package. Write a book. \u0026hellip; Profit!  Similarly, Blackfriday does not support LaTeX math and Pandoc does. I have added the MathJax support to this theme (hugo-lithium) but there is a caveat for plain Markdown posts: you have to include math expressions in a pair of backticks (inline: `$ $`; display style: `$$ $$`), e.g., $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$.1 For R Markdown posts, you do not need the backticks, because Pandoc can identify and process math expressions.\nWhen creating a new post, you have to decide whether the post format is Markdown or R Markdown, and this can be done via the ext argument of the function blogdown::new_post(), e.g.\nblogdown::new_post(\u0026quot;Post Title\u0026quot;, ext = '.Rmd')   This is because we have to protect the math expressions from being interpreted as Markdown. You may not need the backticks if your math expression does not contain any special Markdown syntax such as underscores or asterisks, but it is always a safer choice to use backticks. When you happen to have a pair of literal dollar signs inside the same element, you can escape one dollar sign, e.g., \\$50 and $100 renders \u0026ldquo;\\$50 and $100\u0026rdquo;. ^   ","date":1483159797,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483159797,"objectID":"dac6359e86d39f18210d4aea00ef9fa8","permalink":"/post/2016-12-30-hello-markdown/","publishdate":"2016-12-30T21:49:57-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2016-12-30-hello-markdown/","section":"post","summary":"This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd).
